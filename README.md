# Burn.Party
<p>
With the rise of community-led deflationary tokens, many communities have self-organized “burn events”. The burn event uses the community’s social networks to organize large groups of token holders to voluntarily send some of their tokens to a burn wallet address. The organization is time-consuming, difficult to track, and
not on the blockchain or automated. There have also been a lot of examples where token burn was used as an excuse to deceive investors. Developers can claim to
burn tokens when they're actually sending those tokens to a wallet they control. <p>

The EG multi-chain community burn platform, in collaboration with ChainLink will solve these issues, while creating a central hub for a community to support their token of choice. 

Supported Network - Binance Smart Chain & Ethereum
